[View Count](https://github.com/decaf-dev/obsidian-view-count) is an Obsidian.md plugin for desktop and mobile. It allows you to track the view count for each file in your vault.

Vault Explorer allows you to create a custom filter rule based on view count when this plugin is enabled.

To get started, download the [View Count plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=view-count) from the Obsidian plugin store.

Follow this [guide](/docs/guides/filter-by-view-count/) to filter by view count.
