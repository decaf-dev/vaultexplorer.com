| Name                         | Description                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `File name (A-Z)`            | Sorts based on file name in ascending order          |
| `File name (Z-A)`            | Sorts based on file name in descending order         |
| `Modified time (new to old)` | Sorts based on modification date in descending order |
| `Modified time (old to new)` | Sorts based on modification date in ascending order  |

You may use an Obsidian property instead of the file system time by updating the [modification date setting](/docs/settings#modification-date-property).
