Get started with the Vault Explorer plugin.

## Install the plugin

1. Navigate to the [Vault Explorer plugin link](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=vault-explorer)
2. When the `Open` popup appears, click **Open Obsidian**
3. Wait for Obsidian to start
4. In Obsidian, click **Install**
5. Finally, click **Enable**

## Open the explorer view

Open the vault explorer view by clicking on the compass icon in the left-hand sidebar. You may also run `Open vault explorer view` from the [command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette).

## Switch between views

Views are different visual formats for displaying your vault files. When you first open the explorer view, the `Grid` view will be active. To switch to another view, click one of the view tabs.

You may reorder view tabs by dragging one tab and dropping it onto another tab.

View options can be configured in the plugin settings.

## Filter by favorites

Filters allow you to limit what is displayed in a view. One of the basic filters is the `Favorite filter`. The favorite filter is located below the search bar. 

When the favorite filter is checked, only notes contain a favorite property of `true` will appear. 

You must choose a property for the favorite filter to use. To do this, open the plugin settings. In the **Built-in Properties** section, you will see **Favorite property** setting. Click the dropdown and select a property from your vault.

> [!NOTE]
> The favorite property must be a checkbox

If no properties are listed, please add a [checkbox property](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties) to one of your notes. This property will then appear in the dropdown list.

The favorite filter is applied on top of other filters such as the timestamp filter or the advanced filter.
