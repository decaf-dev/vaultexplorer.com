The grid view displays vault files as cards in a grid. The grid will expand to as many columns as the screen size allows.

## Cover image

By default, the grid card will display a placeholder cover image.

<Image src="views/img/image-placeholder.png" alt="Cover image placeholder" maxWidth="350px"/>

### Image property

When an image property is configured, the plugin will load a cover image from the image provided.

<Image src="views/img/image-property-1.png" alt="Image property" maxWidth="350px"/>
