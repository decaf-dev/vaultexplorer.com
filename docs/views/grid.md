The grid view displays vault files as cards in a grid. The grid will expand to as many columns as the screen size allows.

## Cover image

By default, the grid card will display a gray background as a placeholder.

### Image file

If the file is an image, it will be displayed as the cover image.

### Image property

When the [image url property setting](/docs/settings/#image-url-property) is configured, the plugin will load a cover image from the image provided.

This can be a wiki link to an image file in the vault or an external URL to an image file.
