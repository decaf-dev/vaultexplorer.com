The feed view displays vault files as detailed items in a list. Items include a short display of the file content.

This is a [premium feature](/docs/premium/).

## Settings

By default, level 1 headers are removed. If you would like to enable them, you can change the [remove H1 setting](/docs/settings/#remove-h1).

Content may be fully collapsed (no no lines), by changing the [collapse style setting](/docs/settings/#collapse-style).

The number of lines to display can be updated by changing the [line clamp setting](/docs/settings/#large-screen-line-clamp) for each screen size.
