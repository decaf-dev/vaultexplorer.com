<span className="large-text">Premium features are available to users who purchase a Vault Explorer license.</span>

## License

A license gives you lifetime access to premium Vault Explorer features. These include new views and quality of life improvements. Purchasing a license is also a way to support the development of the plugin.

When you purchase a license, you will receive an email with your license key within 24 hours. This email is currently sent manually. After receiving your license key, you will need to register your device with it.

A device is considered any physical machine such as a desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone. If you have multiple vaults on a machine, they will only be considered as 1 device.


### License Types

There are 2 types of licenses: **Basic** and **Extended**

#### Basic License

The basic license can be used on up to 2 devices.

#### Extended License
 
The extended license can be up on up to 5 devices.
