<span className="large-text">Enable premium features by purchasing a Vault Explorer license.</span>

## License

A license gives you access to premium Vault Explorer features. Purchasing a license is also a way to support development of the plugin.

<PricingComparison/>

## Key distribution

When you purchase a license, you will receive an email with a license key within 24 hours.

## Key usage

Once a license key is activated, it is activated for all vaults on your device.

## Network requests

No network requests are needed for key validation. Keys are validated through an offline algorithm.

## Key sharing

Please do not share your license key with anyone. Shared license keys will be deactivated.

## Old keys

If you bought a license before version **1.36.0**, you will need to enter a new license key. You will be sent a new key by email. This is because the license system has been upgraded.

## Activate your key

1. Open the plugin settings by clicking the gear icon in the upper right corner
2. Scroll down to the **Premium** section
3. Find the **License key** setting
4. Enter your license key received by email

Congratulations! Premium features are now enabled on your device
