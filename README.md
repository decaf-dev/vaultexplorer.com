This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

Install Bun.sh from https://bun.sh/

### Local Development

```
bun run dev
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
bun run build
```

This command generates static content into the `public` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Site map

A site map can be generated from:
https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/

An initial sitemap was already submitted to the Google console and Google will look at `robots.txt` for fetching the newest sitemap from now on.
